<h1 align="center">System Design Experiments</h1>

<p>
This repository contains System Design lab experiments conducted during the
6<sup>th</sup> semester as part of the Computer Science and Engineering curriculum.
The experiments focus on understanding core system design concepts such as
scalability, availability, performance, API design, database modeling, and
real-world system architecture.
</p>

<h2>Experiments Overview</h2>
<p>
Each experiment includes problem analysis, system requirements, high-level and
low-level design, and implementation where applicable. The goal is to bridge
the gap between theoretical concepts and practical system design applications.
</p>
